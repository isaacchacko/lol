# League of Legends Tools

This is a library of some of the programs I use to help me play League of Legends. 

## highest_winrate_botlane.py

This is a program that webscrapes winrate data from op.gg and will print out a list of the winrates, from greatest to least.

## highet_winrate_botlane.exe

The same as the one who shares its name but in an executable form.

## highest_winrate_laner.py

This is a program that requires a specific lane to be inputted before outputting the winrates of that specific lane, greatest to least.

## rune_checker.py

THis is a program that will webscrape and output the specific runes I should play with to have the highest chance of winning.

The reason why I use these instead of actually pulling up the websites is that, when I'm playing League of Legends, my computer will lag, so I wouldn't have time to open up the webpage then let all of the HTML, CSS, and JS to load.
